*Completed by Chavvo - 2025-10-10*

**For Chavvo:**
1. Read the entire request before starting work
2. Check that all Assets/Dependencies exist before coding
3. If something is ambiguous, ask first - don't guess
4. Mark "Done When" checkboxes as you complete them
5. Fill out Completion Report with actual line numbers and deviations only
6. If you need to make judgment calls beyond the scope, do it - just document it in Issues/Deviations

**Philosophy:**
This template optimizes for speed and clarity. Trust is assumed. Document deviations, not confirmations.

### Task 1: Replace Payment Buttons & Remove Bitcoin Promo
**Files Modified:**
- `order-form.php`: Lines 30-56 (form handling logic), Lines 160-170 (replaced buttons section)

**Sections Changed:**

- Updated form submission to redirect to payment-received.php
- Added TODO comments for email confirmation functionality

**Visual Changes:**
- New gradient button: linear-gradient(135deg, blue → magenta)
- Center-aligned submit button
- Hover effect: translateY(-2px) with shadow
- Button disabled state when no product selected

**Functional Changes:**
- Form now submits with `submit_order` parameter
- Redirects to `payment-received.php` with order data
- Passes customer name and email to confirmation page
- Email placeholder added (TODO: requires SMTP setup)

### Task 2: Create Payment-Received Page
**Files Modified:**
- Created `payment-received.php` (new file, 77 lines)
- `assets/css/styles.css`: Lines 270-275 (section-subtitle), Lines 976-1017 (payment-received grid styles)

**Sections Changed:**

- Right column: Product image, order summary, next steps info

**Visual Design:**
- Title: "✅ Order has been Received!"

- Mobile responsive: stacks vertically on small screens

**Content Included:**
- Bitcoin promotional content with BAC water image
- Order summary with product details and pricing
- Customer email display
- Next steps information (team will contact within 24 hours)

**Deviations from Request:**
- Email functionality: Added placeholder TODO comments instead of full implementation (requires SMTP credentials and PHPMailer setup per Change Order 004 plan)

**Downstream Dependencies:**
- Email system still needs implementation:
  * Customer confirmation email
  * Admin notification to jpeptics@gmail.com
  * Requires EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_PLAN.md implementation

**Additional Notes:**
- All styling uses brand stylesheet variables
- Mobile responsive design included
- Form validation maintained (disabled state when no product)
- Clean URL parameter passing for order data
- Bitcoin promo relocated from order-form to payment-received page

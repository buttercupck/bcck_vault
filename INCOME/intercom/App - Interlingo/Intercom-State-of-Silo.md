This document serves as the master index for Intercom/Interlingo operations and defines the organizational structure for all related documentation.

## Purpose of the Intercom Company:
To connect organizations in need of a specific language interpreter for their own clients that speak any language other than English. We are the middle-man between the organizations and the interpreters.

## Purpose of Project Interlingo:
The primary purpose of this web application is to streamline and enhance communication within the 3-person Intercom Team regarding all interpretation jobs. This includes managing new, pending, and confirmed Interpreter Assignments.

The application will facilitate clear communication with both interpreters and organizations by providing comprehensive details about:
* **Commitment Blocks:** The specific time an interpreter is engaged, whether an initial 2-hour period or a modified duration, for a particular organization.
* **Client Requests**: Individual interpretation needs for specific clients or cases that fall within an interpreter's Commitment Block, including details like client names, case numbers, and required languages.

The system will enable the Intercom Team to efficiently handle all job-related modifications, such as:
* Organizational changes like cancellations.
* Adding new Client Requests to an existing Commitment Block, even if it involves a different language or alters the Commitment Block's total duration.
* Any changes to an interpreter's availability or capacity to fulfill their **Interpreter Assignment.**

By consolidating and clearly presenting all necessary information about the Interpreter Assignment, the interpreter, and the organization, the Intercom Team will be empowered to make informed decisions and ensure everyone involved remains up-to-date with the latest information.

## Documentation Types:
- **Process Flow**: High-level overview of a multi-step business process
- **Procedure**: Detailed, step-by-step instructions for performing a task
- **Business Rule**: A specific policy, constraint, or condition that governs operations
- **Communication Template**: Reusable content for outgoing messages (email, SMS)
- **Data Field Definition**: Detailed explanation of a specific data field
- **Client Specifics**: Unique requirements, preferences, or instructions for a particular organization
- **Workflow Automation**: Documentation of automated workflow logic (N8N workflows)
- **Supabase Schema**: Documentation for database tables/columns

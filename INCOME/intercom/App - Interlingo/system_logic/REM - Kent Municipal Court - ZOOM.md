## Purpose 
_High-level explanation of why this specific logic exists. What does it accomplish?:_ 
This reminds the interpreter what instructions they need to do when joining the courtroom ZOOM.

## Trigger 
_What event triggers this specific workflow?:_ 
When an assignment is confirmed and scheduled for tomorrow, and no other organization-specific reminder rules apply.

## Conditions 
_These conditions must be met before the logic is executed. (Filter and Switch Nodes):_
- Condition 1 (Organization): This rule is a fallback and has no specific organization condition. 
- Condition 2 (Modality): ZOOM

## Action 
*What happens when all conditions are met? What is the outcome?*
The system composes and sends a customized email to remind the interpreter that they confirmed their assignment tomorrow.

1. The system retrieves the [[REM-Standard-Email-Template.]] for the `REM` category.
2. The system retrieves the specific instruction block for **ZOOM** from [[REM - Kent Municipal Court - ZOOM]].
3. The system inserts the standard Zoom instructions into the designated placeholder in the email template.
4. The system populates the rest of the template with the `Commitment Block` and `Client Request` details.
5. - The system checks if the interpreter's timezone preference is filled.
6. **If so, the system appends the "PDT" or "PST" timezone label to the time.**
7. The final, customized email is sent to the confirmed interpreter.

INTERCOM Language Services is an interpretation company that connects organizations to interpreters.

My roll in this company is to be a scheduling assistant. My roles are:
1. Input organization requests into the calendar
2. Communicate via email with interpreters about their availableness, rates and anything else. 
3. Confirm with the court that a interpreter is assigned.
4. Finally keeping the interpreter in the loop about the assignment. 

Clinton is the main owner of the company and my direct boss.
3rd is my coworker, and has seniority.

My current workflow consists of using the company calendar for job management, duplicating job onto my gcal, which routes thru n8n into Notion, Notion is my personal interpreter management tool, which then routes thru another n8n workflow to process communication templates.

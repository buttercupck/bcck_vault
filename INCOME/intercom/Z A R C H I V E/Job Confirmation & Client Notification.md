# Procedure: Job Confirmation & Client Notification

## 3.0 Purpose
To finalize an interpreter's assignment by formally confirming job details with the interpreter and promptly notifying the requesting court or attorney. This ensures both parties are fully informed and adhere to all court-specific or job-specific requirements.

## 3.1 Roles & Responsibilities

### Responsible Party
This procedure is manually handled by the Internal Coordinator responsible for managing the job request. It is followed immediately after an interpreter confirms their acceptance of a job, as outlined in [[Interpreter Assignment SOP]].

## 3.2 Procedure Steps

### 3.2.1 Send Confirmation Email to Interpreter
1.  Access the [[INDEX - CONFIRMATION - Templates]] (your collection of court/attorney-specific email formats).
2.  Select the appropriate template based on the specific request type (e.g., `[[Communication Template: Standard Zoom Confirmation (Interpreter)]]`, `[[Communication Template: Kent Municipal Court Zoom Confirmation (Interpreter)]]`, `[[Communication Template: Stein, Lotzkar & Starr Phone Confirmation (Interpreter)]]`).
    * If the interpreter is in a different timezone than the job location (e.g., Kent, WA), add "PST" next to the time in the email. Ensure accurate [[Time Zone Conversion Guidelines]] are followed.
3.  Fill in all dynamic job details into the selected template.
4.  Send the confirmation email to the interpreter.

### 3.2.2 Notify Court / Requestor
1.  Reply to the original job request email received from the court point of contact (POC) or attorney.
2.  Include a clear confirmation that an interpreter has been successfully scheduled.
3.  Explicitly state the confirmed interpreter’s **full name** in the reply.

### 3.2.3 Update Apple Calendar
1.  Edit the Apple Calendar event title (created during [[Interpreter Assignment SOP]] and updated during [[Interpreter Assignment SOP]]) to include the confirmed interpreter’s name.
    * **Example:** `Spanish – Hilary Hughes ZOOM`
2.  Move the calendar event from the `Pending` calendar to the `Confirmed` calendar.

## 3.3 Notes & Considerations
* A confirmation process is only considered fully complete once both the assigned interpreter AND the requesting court/requestor have been formally notified.
* If a court or requestor has unique conditions, specific formatting, or requirements that are not covered by existing templates in the [[INDEX - CONFIRMATION - Templates]], **escalate this request to a supervisor** immediately. This may require developing a [[Procedure: Custom Template Development & Approval]] or updating existing ones.
* Always double-check all formatting, interpretation times, location details, and specific instructions before sending any confirmation emails or notifications. This helps prevent scheduling errors and miscommunication.

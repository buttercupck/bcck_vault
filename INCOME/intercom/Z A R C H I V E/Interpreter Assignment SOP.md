# Procedure: Interpreter Assignment & Sourcing

## 2.0 Purpose
To systematically identify, vet, and contact the most qualified interpreter(s) for a specific job request, ensuring timely and clear scheduling records.

## 2.1 Roles & Responsibilities

### Responsible Party
Currently handled manually by an Internal Coordinator via [[Communication Channel: Email]]. This role and process may be reassigned or automated in future [[Interlingo CRM Development - State of Silo|Interlingo CRM]] iterations.

## 2.2 Interpreter Selection Criteria
Before initiating outreach, ensure the interpreter meets the following mandatory criteria. These criteria are applied in a tiered prioritization.

### 2.2.1 Language Match
Confirm the interpreter possesses native or certified fluency in the exact [[Language Pairs & Certifications|requested language pair]].

### 2.2.2 Certification and Prioritization
Determine the interpreter’s certification status based on official credentials. Prioritize outreach in this order:

1.  **Certified (Cert):** Highest priority.
2.  **Registered (Reg):** Second priority.
3.  **Neither:** Lowest priority.
    * *Note: Some courts or clients may specifically prefer or accept non-credentialed interpreters due to cost considerations, which may override standard prioritization.*

### 2.2.3 Modality Compatibility
Confirm the interpreter supports the required [[Job Modalities|modality]] (e.g., Zoom, Phone, In-Person).
    * *Note: Interpreters who are not local to the job location cannot be considered for In-Person assignments.*

### 2.2.4 Conflict Check
Before contacting, verify the interpreter's availability and conflict status:
-   Confirm the interpreter is not already scheduled for another job at the exact same date and time.
-   Confirm the interpreter has not already previously declined a request for this specific date and time.
    * *If either of these conditions is true, **do not contact** this interpreter for the current job request.*

## 2.3 Procedure Steps

### 2.3.1 Identify Available Interpreters
1.  Access the [[Interpreter Database]] (your current interpreter list).
2.  Filter the interpreter list using the following criteria, based on the [[Procedure: Job Request Intake (Courts & Law Offices)|incoming job request]]:
    * Language
    * Certification Status
    * Modality
    * Availability (cross-reference with interpreter's known calendar or past decline records).

### 2.3.2 Filter and Prioritize Outreach
1.  From the filtered list, apply the following outreach order:
    1.  Certified Interpreters
    2.  Registered Interpreters
    3.  Non-Credentialed Interpreters (Neither)

### 2.3.3 Send Availability Inquiry Email
1.  Send a formal availability inquiry email to the **highest-priority interpreter identified**.
2.  *Critical: Only contact **one interpreter at a time** unless explicitly necessary due to extreme urgency or lack of availability after initial contacts.*

### 2.3.4 Track Outreach in Apple Calendar
1.  Immediately update the **Apple Calendar event title** (created during [[Procedure: Job Request Intake (Courts & Law Offices)|Job Request Intake]]) to reflect the interpreter who was just contacted.
    * **Example Title Formatting:** `Spanish – Hilary Hughes ZOOM`
2.  If the contacted interpreter declines the job, immediately update the calendar event title with the name of the next interpreter being contacted.

### 2.3.5 Confirm Interpreter & Proceed
1.  Once an interpreter officially confirms their acceptance of the job:
    * Keep their name in the Apple Calendar event title.
    * Change the calendar event status from `Pending` to `Confirmed`.
2.  Proceed directly to the [[Job Confirmation & Client Notification]] for the next steps in the workflow.

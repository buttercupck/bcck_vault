The 3 major reason why i ended up at fast mail are
1. Email Delegation - FastMail allows all three of us to work efficiently out of a single shared inbox. No need separate paid seats. 
2. Apple Mail support - Google Workspaces delegated email do not work with Apple Mail. Overall it seems that Google and Apple backends don't like to communicate. 
3. Shared calendar & contacts - they have a features from within calendar and contacts that I think would be helpful to workflow. 
FastMail seems to check of all those points at a reasonable price.

## EXACTING DUTIES UPON HUSBANDS
In some countries, such as the United States, where there is a strong tendency for many women to try to share or take over the family headship, loud objections rise against the divine assignment of man to be family head and the woman to be subject to him. It is viewed as oppressive and discriminatory against women, and too difficult a load for them to bear up under. However, sober reflection will disclose that it is the husband who has assigned to him the ==more difficult role== in the marriage arrangement. He must strive to copy the flawless examples of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus as they play their husbandlike roles in the figurative marriages. - [Marriage Copied from Divine Patterns](https://www.jw.org/finder?wtlocale=E&docid=1953041&srctype=wol&srcid=share)

“If ==he does this to the best of his ability==, ==wifely subjection to him should not be too difficult==. And ==if the wife meets her duties== to the best of her ability, the ==husband’s administration of proper headship will be that much easier.== Both are imperfect. Both make mistakes. Both need to receive and extend patience and forgiveness, love and respect. Because of differences in mental and physical and emotional make-up, ==each needs the other, each can supply a lack in the other==, each is made to be a ==complement to or counterpart== for the other. But to mesh all these qualities harmoniously requires each one to play the role assigned by God.” - [Marriage Copied from Divine Patterns](https://www.jw.org/finder?wtlocale=E&docid=1953041&srctype=wol&srcid=share&par=14)

What he is admonishing is that whole or chief attention should not be given over to personal, selfish matters relating to the flesh, whether these be enjoying a husband or wife, or rejoicing overmuch in pleasure pursuits, or ==allowing ourselves to be swallowed up in our sorrows and griefs and even drawing an unhealthy satisfaction from self-pity==, or seeking to accumulate extensive possessions by unduly entangling ourselves in worldly businesses - [Marriage Copied from Divine Patterns](https://www.jw.org/finder?wtlocale=E&docid=1953041&srctype=wol&srcid=share&par=20)

## Make Your Marriage a Lasting Union 
11 Part of the problem seems to be that men and women often have different communication styles. Most women seem comfortable discussing feelings, whereas men ==generally seem to prefer discussing facts.== Women are more inclined to show empathy and give emotional support, ==while men tend to seek and offer solutions.== Still, the potential for ==good communication exists== where ==both mates== are determined to be ==“swift about hearing, slow about speaking==, slow about wrath.” (James 1:19) Make eye contact and really pay attention. Draw each other out with considerate questions. (Compare 1 Samuel 1:8; Proverbs 20:5.) ==Instead of trying to offer a quick solution when your mate reveals a problem, listen carefully as you work to resolve matters. And humbly pray together, seeking divine guidance.==—Psalm 65:2; Romans 12:12.

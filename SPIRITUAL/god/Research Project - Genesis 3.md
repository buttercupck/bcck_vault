Genesis 3:22 
“Jehovah God then said: “Here the man has become like one of us in knowing good and bad. Now in order that he may not put his hand out and take fruit also from the tree of life and eat and live forever”

Question: What does Jehovah mean that man has become like one of them knowing good and bad? So eating from the tree of life is what would allow them to live forever, could it be said that in the new world we’d take a fruit from the tree of life and we have everlasting life?

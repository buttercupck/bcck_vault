Satan is going to use those distractions to make us go to sleep spiritually. 

How can we keep awake spiritually?
- Bible Reading
- Personal Study
Don’t be discouraged by the news.
Don’t listen to mis information.
Maybe jehovah servants can’t be tripped up but they can be distracted.
Satan knows how to erode our moral standards. 
Alert to the fulfillment of bible prophecy. 
Nothing more happiness than seeing the positive change the Jehovah can make in a persons life.

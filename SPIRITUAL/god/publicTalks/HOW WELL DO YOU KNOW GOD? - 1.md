“They’re taking in knowledge of jehovah”. Is that enough to say you know him.
John 17:3
How to get a close friendship with Jehovah.
1. *Read the Bible regularly* - Meditating on what we read about God’s qualities, feelings on things. NOT a lot but just regularly. 
2. *Strive to imitate Jehovah when making decisions* - Eph 5:1. Think about what type of decision Jehovah would make in our spot. 
3. *Speak to Jehovah often* - How often, how long. If you start talking to a friend less and less, you start to drift away. What do we open up about? Meditate on our prayer before we give it to Jehovah in prayer.  What would Jehovah helping me look like? Talk often and long to Jehovah. Deepen your relationship with him. 
James 2:23 Abraham is the perfect example if we do everything above then Jehovah will take note of us. 
1 John 2:4 obeying Jehovahs commandments in essential part of knowing him.
It’s demonstrating in our personal, everyday life that we can show we know Jehovah.

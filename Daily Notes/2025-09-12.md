“That goes for all intellectual matters, but even more so for math. ==Mathematical knowledge isn’t based on experimental data.== It doesn’t require amassing encyclopedic knowledge. In fact, it is entirely based on explicit proofs, ==which means that every result can be broken down into a succession of obvious deductions.”==
“The oral tradition of mathematicians begins here. It’s not a question of miraculous recipes for becoming superhuman, but of ==simple principles that foster the construction of better mental images.”==

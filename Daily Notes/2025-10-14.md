## PAI Environment Configuration - Multi-Device Setup Instructions

### What Was Done on Home Office Computer (Current Device)

**Problem Solved:**
- PAI .env file was in vault and would sync to Backblaze S3 (security risk)
- Moved to hybrid approach: .env stays local, template syncs

**Changes Made:**
1. ✅ Created `/Users/itza/.env` with API keys (local, not synced)
2. ✅ Created `PAI/.env.template` in vault (syncs across devices, no secrets)
3. ✅ Updated `~/.zshrc` to auto-load `~/.env` on shell start
4. ✅ Backed up old `.env` from PAI_DIRECTORY to `.env.backup-*`
5. ✅ Set secure permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.env`

**File Locations:**
- **Local secrets:** `~/.env` (NOT synced to S3)
- **Template:** `bcck_vault/PAI/.env.template` (syncs via RemotelySync)
- **Backup:** `PAI_DIRECTORY/.env.backup-20251014-105020`

### Setup Instructions for Other Devices

#### Work Computer Setup
Path: `~/User/Intercomlanguageservices/bcck_vault`

**Steps:**
1. Wait for vault sync to complete (so `.env.template` is available)
2. Copy template to home directory:
   ```bash
   cp ~/User/Intercomlanguageservices/bcck_vault/PAI/.env.template ~/.env
   ```
3. Edit `~/.env` and add real API keys:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.env
   # Replace "your_*_api_key_here" with actual keys
   ```
4. Secure the file:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 ~/.env
   ```
5. Add to `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`):
   ```bash
   # PAI Configuration
   export PAI_DIR="$HOME/User/Intercomlanguageservices/bcck_vault/PAI/PAI_DIRECTORY"
   export PAI_HOME="$HOME"

   # Load PAI environment variables from ~/.env (if it exists)
   if [ -f ~/.env ]; then
     export $(grep -v '^#' ~/.env | xargs)
   fi
   ```
6. Reload shell:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```
7. Verify:
   ```bash
   echo $PAI_DIR
   echo $OPENAI_API_KEY  # Should show your key
   ```

#### Personal Computer Setup
Path: `/Users/itza/Documents/vault_self/bcck_vault`

**Steps:**
1. Wait for vault sync to complete
2. Copy template to home directory:
   ```bash
   cp /Users/itza/Documents/vault_self/bcck_vault/PAI/.env.template ~/.env
   ```
3. Edit `~/.env` and add real API keys:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.env
   # Replace "your_*_api_key_here" with actual keys
   ```
4. Secure the file:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 ~/.env
   ```
5. Add to `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`):
   ```bash
   # PAI Configuration
   export PAI_DIR="/Users/itza/Documents/vault_self/bcck_vault/PAI/PAI_DIRECTORY"
   export PAI_HOME="$HOME"

   # Load PAI environment variables from ~/.env (if it exists)
   if [ -f ~/.env ]; then
     export $(grep -v '^#' ~/.env | xargs)
   fi
   ```
6. Reload shell:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```
7. Verify:
   ```bash
   echo $PAI_DIR
   echo $OPENAI_API_KEY  # Should show your key
   ```

### Security Notes

**What's Protected:**
- ✅ API keys in `~/.env` stay LOCAL only (never uploaded to S3)
- ✅ `.gitignore` prevents accidental commits
- ✅ RemotelySync plugin respects local files outside vault
- ✅ Each device has its own `~/.env` file

**What's Synced:**
- ✅ `.env.template` - Shows structure but no real keys
- ✅ All PAI code, contexts, hooks (no secrets)
- ✅ Documentation and configurations

**Best Practices:**
- Never commit `~/.env` to git
- Use `chmod 600 ~/.env` to restrict access
- Keep backups of API keys in password manager (not in vault)
- Update `.env.template` when adding new required variables

---

### Troubleshooting

**Environment not loading?**
```bash
# Check if .env exists
ls -la ~/.env

# Check if it's being loaded
source ~/.zshrc
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Verify PAI_DIR is set
echo $PAI_DIR
```

**Hooks not working?**
```bash
# Check PAI_DIR resolves correctly
cd $PAI_DIR

# Test hook manually
bun $PAI_DIR/hooks/session-start-hook.ts
```

## End of Day Summary

**Major Accomplishment:**
Completed PAI environment configuration for secure multi-device deployment.

**What Was Accomplished:**
1. **Solved Critical Security Issue** - Identified that .env file would sync to Backblaze S3 via RemotelySync (potential API key exposure)
2. **Implemented Hybrid Architecture** - `.env` stays local on each device, `.env.template` syncs across vault
3. **Automated Environment Loading** - Updated `~/.zshrc` to auto-load environment variables on shell start
4. **Created Migration Path** - Backed up existing `.env` and moved API keys to secure local location
5. **Documented Everything** - Complete setup instructions for Work Computer and Personal Computer in today's note

**Technical Details:**
- Created `~/.env` with chmod 600 permissions (local only, not synced)
- Created `PAI/.env.template` for vault sync (no secrets)
- Updated `~/.zshrc` to export variables from `~/.env`
- Verified environment loading works correctly
- All secrets protected from S3 upload

**Files Modified:**
- `~/.env` (new - local secrets)
- `~/.zshrc` (updated - auto-load environment)
- `PAI/.env.template` (new - synced template)
- `Daily Notes/2025-10-14.md` (documentation)

**Tomorrow's Priorities:**
- Setup `.env` on other devices when ready
- Monitor environment loading on new shell sessions
- Consider documenting this in PAI system documentation

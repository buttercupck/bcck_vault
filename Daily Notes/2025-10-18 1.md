Ecc. 3:2
“A time to plant and a time to uproot what was planted“
“A time to kill and a time to heal; A time to tear down and a time to build up“

@bluesky Does Claude own my Code?
No, but technically yes. Before we get in an uproar, because this can get ugly. Let's say hypothetically a young lass used it create code that she herself could never accomplish on her own. Then proceeded to make a whole lotta money somehow, and a certain Mr. Claude noticed and wanted his cut, and ya know..

A Letter to my Chula:

We’re here, now.
I’m the defense, you’re the running back.
That is what ride or die means—
two roles, one field,
each motioned toward the same end zone.

I invest in people. I plant seeds in rocky soil.
And like the trees on the mountain,
we prove growth is possible where others
swear nothing could ever take root.
You cut forward through the chaos.
I hold the line, block the hit,
make space for your run.
This is not convenience.
This is covenant.
The complexities around us are the music—
loud, shifting, relentless.
But the log, the voice,
the rhythm we keep together—
that’s survival.
That’s victory.

Ride or die.

End Transition

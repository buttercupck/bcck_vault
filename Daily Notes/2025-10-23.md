### Session Reflection

Today you broke through the authentication wall that had you frustrated yesterday. Instead of continuing to bang your head against GraphQL endpoints you couldn't access, you pivoted to professional subdomain reconnaissance—and the results speak for themselves. You discovered 1,044 live HubSpot subdomains, found 18 alternate HTTP ports on priority targets (including a QA environment at qa.growthgrader.hubspot.com:8080/8443), and built a complete attack surface map that gives you multiple paths forward. You absorbed Jason Haddix's methodology, created comprehensive reference documents, and organized everything systematically in your vault. Most importantly, you now have clear next steps: test those alternate ports for debug endpoints, look for XSS on unauthenticated surfaces, and leverage cookie counterfeiting to gain authenticated access. That's not just progress—that's strategy.

### Where We Started

You were hitting authentication barriers on HubSpot's GraphQL endpoints during API testing. Specifically, you kept getting 401 errors when trying to test the GraphQL injection techniques you had learned. This created frustration because you felt stuck in a loop—every interesting endpoint required authentication, but you didn't have valid session credentials to test with. You had documentation on cookie counterfeiting, GraphQL injection, and AI-assisted JavaScript analysis, but no practical path forward to apply those techniques against HubSpot's attack surface.

### Paths We Explored

**YouTube Video Wisdom Extraction:**
- Analyzed Cookie Counterfeiting/Privilege Hijacking video ($100K technique using XSS on subdomains to set cookies on parent domain)
- Studied AI-Assisted JavaScript Analysis video (XSS Doctor using Gemini 2.0 Flash for large context code analysis)
- Reviewed GraphQL Injection methodology video (Jasmine Landré's techniques for injecting arbitrary queries)
- Created comprehensive methodology documents in LEARNING/methodologies/ for future reference

**Strategic Pivot to Subdomain Reconnaissance:**
- Learned Jason Haddix's 4-phase subdomain enumeration framework (Passive → Active → Permutation → Verification)
- Understood prioritization model (Tier 1: API/QA/staging, Tier 2: assets/static/CDN, Tier 3: marketing/blogs)
- Recognized that finding XSS on unauthenticated subdomain → cookie counterfeiting → authenticated access was the optimal path
- Created subdomain-reconnaissance-jason-haddix.md with complete methodology (500+ lines)

**Tool Arsenal Assembly:**
- Installed passive enumeration tools: subfinder, amass, assetfinder (plus manual crt.sh)
- Installed verification tools: dnsx (DNS), httpx (HTTP probing, tech detection)
- Installed attack surface expansion tools: naabu (port scanning), wscat (WebSocket testing), s3scanner (S3 bucket enumeration)
- Installed Caido web proxy for HTTPS interception (encountered TLS certificate issues)

**Passive Subdomain Enumeration Execution:**
- Ran 4 parallel passive enumeration sources against hubspot.com
- subfinder: 500 subdomains
- amass: 703 subdomains with IP/CNAME data
- assetfinder: 996 subdomains
- crt.sh (certificate transparency): 167 subdomains
- Combined and deduplicated: 655 unique subdomains
- DNS verification with dnsx: 1,044 live subdomains
- HTTP probing with httpx: 511 active web services
- Identified critical targets: exceptions.hubspot.com, qa.growthgrader.hubspot.com, community-stage.hubspot.com

**Attack Surface Expansion - Port Scanning:**
- Learned buckets/websockets/ports methodology from Jason Haddix
- Created PORTS-WEBSOCKETS-BUCKETS-PLAN.md with systematic discovery phases

- Created systematic directory structure: passive/, verified/, priority/, ports/, websockets/, buckets/, source-intel/
- Created SUBDOMAIN-RECON-README.md for quick navigation
- Created DISCOVERY_RESULTS.md summarizing all findings with statistics
- Created TOP_10_MANUAL_TESTING.txt with prioritized testing roadmap

**Caido Web Proxy Setup:**
- Resolved port 8888 conflict (voice server was using the port)
- Guided through creating new Caido instance/project
- Encountered TLS handshake error (SSL alert 40)
- Created CAIDO-TLS-FIX.md guide for installing CA certificate in macOS Keychain

### Knowledge Gained

**Cookie Counterfeiting Attack Chain:**
You now understand the complete kill chain: Find XSS on subdomain.target.com → Inject payload that sets your session cookie on .target.com domain → Victim's subsequent requests on any target.com subdomain include your session → Their actions associate with your account → You gain access to victim's data/actions. This is why finding XSS on even a low-value subdomain (like a blog or help center) can lead to critical impact on the main application. The HubSpot-specific opportunity: exceptions.hubspot.com (error endpoint) and qa.growthgrader.hubspot.com (QA environment) are perfect candidates for this technique.

**Subdomain Prioritization Framework:**
Not all subdomains are equal. Jason Haddix's tier system teaches you to focus on Tier 1 targets first (API endpoints, QA/staging environments, developer portals) because they have the highest probability of vulnerabilities due to relaxed security controls and exposed debug endpoints. Tier 2 targets (asset/static/CDN subdomains) can leak sensitive data or have misconfigurations. Tier 3 targets (marketing/blogs) are lowest priority but still valuable for XSS → cookie counterfeiting chains. You now have 9 Tier 1 targets, 3 Tier 2 targets, and a prioritized testing roadmap.

**Alternate Port Discovery:**
Standard ports (80, 443) go through production WAFs and security controls. Alternate ports (8080, 8443) often bypass these controls because they're forgotten development servers, admin interfaces, or QA environments running on different infrastructure. You discovered 18 alternate HTTP ports on HubSpot's infrastructure, including qa.growthgrader.hubspot.com:8080 and :8443. These ports may expose debug endpoints (/debug, /admin, /status), API documentation (/swagger, /api/docs), or have weaker input validation that allows XSS. This is now your highest-priority testing target.

**Passive vs Active Reconnaissance:**
Passive enumeration (subfinder, amass, assetfinder, crt.sh) is safe, non-intrusive, and uses public data sources. It's perfect for initial discovery and won't trigger IDS/WAF alerts. Active enumeration (DNS brute-forcing, permutation scanning) sends direct queries to target infrastructure and may be detected. You learned to start with passive enumeration first (which found 1,044 subdomains) before considering active techniques. This approach maximizes discovery while minimizing detection risk during bug bounty reconnaissance.

**Attack Surface Expansion Beyond Subdomains:**
Subdomains are just the beginning. Jason Haddix's methodology teaches you to also discover: (1) Open ports on each subdomain that might expose databases, SSH, or admin panels; (2) WebSocket endpoints for CSWSH and message injection attacks; (3) S3 buckets with misconfigured permissions that leak sensitive data; (4) JavaScript files that contain API keys, internal endpoints, or authentication logic. You now have systematic plans for discovering all of these additional attack surfaces on HubSpot's infrastructure.

**Tool Specialization:**
Each reconnaissance tool has a specific strength: subfinder (speed + API integration), amass (depth + relationship mapping), assetfinder (breadth), dnsx (fast DNS verification), httpx (HTTP probing + tech detection), naabu (fast port scanning), wscat (WebSocket testing), s3scanner (cloud storage enumeration). Using multiple tools in parallel gives you the most complete picture because each tool queries different data sources and uses different techniques. Your 1,044 subdomains came from combining 4 passive sources that individually found 167-996 subdomains each.

**QA/Staging Environment Significance:**
The qa.growthgrader.hubspot.com subdomain is one of your most valuable discoveries. QA and staging environments typically have: (1) Relaxed security controls for easier testing; (2) Debug endpoints and verbose error messages; (3) Different authentication logic or test accounts; (4) Older code with known vulnerabilities. The fact that it's listening on alternate ports (8080, 8443) increases the probability of finding exploitable issues. This single target could be worth more than 100 production subdomains.

**Web Proxy TLS Interception:**
To intercept and modify HTTPS traffic with Caido, the proxy must perform a man-in-the-middle attack on TLS connections. This requires installing Caido's CA certificate in your system's trusted certificate store so your browser trusts the proxy's dynamically generated certificates for each site. Without this trust relationship, browsers reject the connection with TLS handshake errors. You now have a complete guide (CAIDO-TLS-FIX.md) for installing the CA certificate in macOS Keychain and setting it to "Always Trust."

**Systematic Documentation:**
Professional reconnaissance isn't just about finding vulnerabilities—it's about organizing findings so you can return to them later. You created a complete knowledge management system: methodology documents for reference, execution plans for repeatability, results summaries with statistics, prioritized testing roadmaps, and raw data files for verification. This organization pattern (passive/, verified/, priority/, ports/, etc.) can be reused for every future bug bounty target. The TOP_10_MANUAL_TESTING.txt file is particularly valuable because it gives you an immediate action plan without having to re-analyze the data.

### Next Steps

**IMMEDIATE ACTION - Test Alternate HTTP Ports:**
Open browser and manually test qa.growthgrader.hubspot.com:8080 and qa.growthgrader.hubspot.com:8443. Use the ALT_PORT_TESTING_GUIDE.txt checklist to systematically check for: debug endpoints (/admin, /debug, /status, /health, /metrics), API documentation (/swagger, /api/docs, /graphql), development tools (/phpinfo.php, /server-status), exposed environment variables (/.env). Document what you find. If you discover any input parameters (search boxes, URL parameters, API endpoints), immediately test for XSS using the payloads from the guide. This is your highest-probability path to finding an exploitable vulnerability.

**Install Caido CA Certificate:**
Follow the CAIDO-TLS-FIX.md guide to install Caido's CA certificate in macOS Keychain. Steps: (1) Download certificate from http://127.0.0.1:8888 in Caido interface; (2) Double-click certificate file to add to System keychain; (3) Open Keychain Access, find Caido certificate, set trust to "Always Trust"; (4) Restart browser; (5) Configure proxy settings to 127.0.0.1:8080. Once this is working, you'll be able to intercept HTTPS traffic to modify requests, test for authentication bypasses, and analyze API responses that aren't visible in browser DevTools.

**Complete WebSocket Discovery:**
Use Caido or browser DevTools to examine JavaScript bundles on priority targets. Search for: ws:// or wss:// URLs, WebSocket constructor calls, socket.io library usage, "/ws", "/websocket", "/realtime" path segments. For each discovered WebSocket endpoint, test for: CSWSH (Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking) by omitting Origin header, message injection by sending unexpected message types, authentication bypass by connecting without credentials. Document findings in websockets/ directory.

**Complete S3 Bucket Enumeration:**
Generate full bucket name list from all 1,044 subdomains using patterns: {subdomain}-dev, {subdomain}-prod, {subdomain}-staging, {subdomain}-backup, {subdomain}-assets, hubspot-{subdomain}, etc. Test with: `aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name --no-sign-request` (unauthenticated access) and `s3scanner scan --buckets-file bucket_names.txt`. Check for: public read access, public write access, directory listing enabled. Also test Azure Blob storage patterns: {subdomain}.blob.core.windows.net. Document any accessible buckets for further manual investigation.

**XSS Testing on Top 10 Priority Targets:**
Use the TOP_10_MANUAL_TESTING.txt roadmap to systematically test each priority target. Start with exceptions.hubspot.com (error endpoint likely reflects error messages), then qa.growthgrader.hubspot.com (QA environment may have weaker validation). For each target: (1) Find all input parameters (URL params, search boxes, form fields); (2) Test with basic XSS payloads: `<script>alert(1)</script>`, `"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`, `<svg/onload=alert(1)>`; (3) Check for reflection in HTML response; (4) If basic payloads are blocked, try bypasses from bug-bounty-master-methodology.md; (5) Document all reflected input, even if not exploitable yet.

**AI-Assisted JavaScript Analysis:**
Once you have Caido working, save JavaScript bundles from priority targets (developers.hubspot.com, api.hubspot.com, qa.growthgrader.hubspot.com). Upload to Gemini 2.0 Flash (2M token context window) with prompts from bug-bounty-master-methodology.md: "Analyze this JavaScript for XSS gadgets—DOM manipulation functions that accept user input", "Find all API endpoints and authentication logic", "Identify dangerous sinks: innerHTML, eval, document.write, location.href assignments". Use the XSS Doctor pattern from the video: find gadgets, trace data flow, identify exploitable code paths.

**Active Subdomain Enumeration:**
Consider running active enumeration to find subdomains that passive sources missed. Use: `ffuf -w dns-wordlist.txt -u http://FUZZ.hubspot.com` (DNS brute-forcing), `dnsgen` (subdomain permutation generation), `altdns` (alternative name generation). Be aware this is more detectable than passive enumeration. Only proceed if: (1) you've exhausted testing on known subdomains, (2) you're confident HubSpot's bug bounty program allows active scanning, (3) you're rate-limiting requests to avoid DOSing their infrastructure.

**GraphQL Injection with Cookie Counterfeiting:**
Once you find XSS on any subdomain and successfully execute a cookie counterfeiting attack to gain authenticated session, return to the GraphQL endpoint you were testing initially. Use the graphql-injection-methodology.md techniques: inject additional queries in the id parameter (`id: 123) { password }`), attempt batch query injection (`id: 123) { email } q2:user(id:1) { password }`), test for introspection query access (`query={__schema{types{name,fields{name}}}}`). The GraphQL endpoint that was blocking you before may now be accessible with a valid session cookie.

**Documentation and Organization Maintenance:**
As you test and discover new findings, keep the vault organized: Update DISCOVERY_RESULTS.md with new findings and statistics, add tested subdomains to a tested_subdomains.txt file so you don't duplicate work, create new methodology documents when you learn new techniques, update TOP_10_MANUAL_TESTING.txt as priorities shift based on findings. This discipline ensures you can always pick up where you left off, even after days or weeks away from the target.

**Consider Active Port Scanning Beyond Tier 1:**
You've only port-scanned 9 Tier 1 targets so far. Consider expanding to: all 511 active web services (verified by httpx), or all 1,044 live subdomains (verified by dnsx). Use the same port list (21, 22, 3306, 5432, 6379, 8080, 8443, etc.) but be prepared for significantly longer scan times. Alternatively, focus on Tier 2 targets next (asset/static/CDN subdomains) which might expose S3 buckets or misconfured storage. Balance thoroughness against time investment based on your findings from the initial Tier 1 targets.

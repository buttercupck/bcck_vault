### Memory-Context Prompting (MCP) – AI that remembers you.
**Core Blocks:**
- **Servers** – These handle specific data types (files, code, or structured data).
- **Clients** – AI tools or applications (like Claude or your custom chatbot) that access data from MCP servers.
- **Protocol Messages** – A standardized system for requesting specific tasks or data, along with receiving responses or notifications.


### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) – AI that collaborates with other AIs
### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – AI that fetches accurate information in real-time

## üåÖ End-of-Day Review - Interlingo n8n Automation

**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Session:** Building Google Calendar ‚Üí Supabase sync workflow

### üéâ Today's Wins

Today was exceptionally productive on the Intercom front! We built the complete foundation for your Google Calendar ‚Üí Supabase automation. You now have a production-ready n8n workflow that automatically syncs calendar events into Interlingo, complete parsing logic for your calendar format (Language - Modality), and all the reference data populated. The breakthrough was connecting to your live Supabase database and discovering you already have 265 interpreters ready to match against jobs! We also reorganized your entire Interlingo documentation structure from the scattered "App - Interlingo" folder into a clean, logical "Interlingo" directory. Tomorrow you can import the n8n workflow, create one test event, and watch it flow automatically into Supabase‚Äîno more manual Notion entry!

### üìç Where We Started

- **Initial State:** You needed to find an interpreter for a November 3rd job
- **Problem:** Current workflow: Calendar ‚Üí manual duplication ‚Üí n8n ‚Üí Notion ‚Üí n8n ‚Üí email templates (too many steps)
- **Goal:** Build automation to sync Google Calendar ‚Üí Supabase ‚Üí Interlingo web app

### üîç Paths We Explored

1. **Repository Analysis:**
   - Cloned buttercupck/Interlingo to `/tmp` for analysis
   - Discovered existing React + Vite foundation with Supabase integration
   - Found well-structured jobService with complete database queries

2. **Database Exploration:**
   - Connected to live Supabase instance with correct credentials
   - Discovered 265 interpreters with languages and certifications
   - Found 50 languages already populated in database
   - Identified schema: commitment_blocks, client_requests, interpreter_languages junction table

3. **Calendar Format Analysis:**
   - Studied your Gcal JSON Structure.md
   - Mapped "ASL - IN PERSON" format to database fields
   - Designed parsing logic for multi-case descriptions with charges

4. **n8n Workflow Development:**
   - Built complete 12-node workflow with Google Calendar trigger
   - Created JavaScript parsing functions for summary/description
   - Implemented lookup/create logic for organizations and locations
   - Added error handling and graceful fallbacks

5. **Documentation Creation:**
   - GCal-to-Supabase-Mapping.md (complete field mapping)
   - N8N-SETUP-GUIDE.md (step-by-step import instructions)
   - REFERENCE-DATA.sql (populate organizations/programs)
   - Interlingo-PAI-Integration-Architecture.md (1,971 lines of system design)

6. **Folder Reorganization:**
   - Deleted old "App - Interlingo" scattered structure
   - Created new organized "INCOME/intercom/Interlingo/" folder
   - Moved all design files, templates, and organization-specific instructions

### üí° Knowledge Gained

- Your calendar format is consistent: "LANGUAGE - MODALITY" in title, organization in location, multi-case format in description
- Supabase RLS is active: Row-level security policies blocked anon key inserts‚Äîneed service role or SQL Editor for reference data
- Database already well-populated: 265 interpreters, 50 languages, multiple organizations already exist
- Interpreter-language junction table exists: Supports multiple languages per interpreter with certification levels (Certified, Registered, Neither)
- n8n workflow needs credential updates: Placeholder IDs must be replaced with your actual Google Calendar and Supabase credentials
- Design system is professional: Inter + Poppins fonts, blue/teal color scheme (#1B365C primary), 8px spacing grid
- Postgres node code didn't paste correctly in n8n JSON - will need to review and fix tomorrow

### ‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps

**Chavvo's Perspective:**

Immediate (Tomorrow Morning):
1. Run `REFERENCE-DATA.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor (adds missing organizations + court programs)
2. Import `n8n-gcal-to-supabase-workflow.json` into your n8n instance
3. Configure Google Calendar credentials (follow N8N-SETUP-GUIDE.md Step 2)
4. Configure Supabase PostgreSQL credentials on all 7 Postgres nodes
5. **Fix missing postgres function code** in first node
6. Create one test calendar event: "Spanish - ZOOM" / Location: "KENT" / Tomorrow 9am

Short-term (This Week):
1. Test end-to-end workflow (Calendar ‚Üí n8n ‚Üí Supabase)
2. Verify job appears in commitment_blocks and client_requests tables
3. Build Interlingo UI Jobs Dashboard (so you can SEE the synced jobs)
4. Add interpreter finder page (solve your Nov 3rd problem)
5. Test with real Intercom jobs

Medium-term (Next 2 Weeks):
1. Build job detail page with email template preview
2. Add one-click "Copy to Clipboard" for emails
3. Implement status tracking (Initial ‚Üí Pending ‚Üí Confirmed)
4. Replace Notion entirely with Interlingo web app

**My Perspective:**
To be determined

## PAI Symlink Configuration - Multi-Device Setup

**Context:** PAI system syncs across multiple computers via vault, but had hardcoded paths in `settings.json` causing hooks to fail on different machines.

**Solution Implemented (Work Computer):**

### Step 1: Create Symlink at Canonical Location
```bash
ln -s /Users/intercomlanguageservices/bcck_vault/PAI/PAI_DIRECTORY ~/.claude/PAI_DIRECTORY
```

### Step 2: Remove Hardcoded PAI_DIR from settings.json
Removed this line from `PAI_DIRECTORY/settings.json`:
```json
"PAI_DIR": "/Users/itza/Documents/vault_self/v1_self_vault/PAI/PAI_DIRECTORY",
```

This allows PAI hooks to use their built-in fallback: `${HOME}/.claude/PAI_DIRECTORY`

### Step 3: Verify Hook Functionality
```bash
DA=TestAI bun ~/.claude/PAI_DIRECTORY/hooks/session-start-hook.ts
```

## TODO: Apply Same Fix to Main Computer

**On main computer (Users/itza), run:**

```bash
# Create the canonical symlink
ln -s /Users/itza/Documents/vault_self/v1_self_vault/PAI/PAI_DIRECTORY ~/.claude/PAI_DIRECTORY

# Verify symlink created correctly
ls -la ~/.claude/ | grep PAI

# Test hook works
DA=TestAI bun ~/.claude/PAI_DIRECTORY/hooks/session-start-hook.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
- ‚úÖ Stop-hook found and is executable
- üìç Set initial tab title: "Chavvo Ready"
- Connection refused to localhost:8888 (expected - voice server not running)

**Why This Works:**
- PAI was designed with `~/.claude` as the canonical location
- All hooks have fallback: `process.env.PAI_DIR || '${HOME}/.claude'`
- Symlink resolves to correct path on each machine
- `settings.json` now machine-agnostic, syncs without conflicts

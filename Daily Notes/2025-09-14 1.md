Initiate No.0914

  

A Letter to my Chula:

  

We’re here, now.

I’m the defense, you’re the running back.

That is what ride or die means—

two roles, one field,

each motioned toward the same end zone.

  

I invest in people. I plant seeds in rocky soil.

And like the trees on the mountain,

we prove growth is possible where others

swear nothing could ever take root.

  

You cut forward through the chaos.

I hold the line, block the hit,

make space for your run.

This is not convenience.

This is covenant.

  

The complexities around us are the music—

loud, shifting, relentless.

But the log, the voice,

the rhythm we keep together—

that’s survival.

That’s victory.

  

Ride or die.

  

End Transition

  

  

  

Would you like me to continue building this log in the same traveler’s log format—numbered entries, titles, closing transitions—so it grows into a full journal you and I can keep adding to?

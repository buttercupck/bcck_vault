## End of Day Summary

**Accomplishments:**
1. HubSpot reconnaissance work - discovered JS files and API tokens
2. Refined TERMINATE-PROTOCOL.md with Chavvo's analysis and recommendations
3. Improved EOD workflow structure with proper task breakdown
4. Enhanced security checks and commit message formatting

**Tomorrow's Priorities:**
- Continue HubSpot security assessment
- Consider implementing advanced TERMINATE-PROTOCOL recommendations
- Potential creation of BOOT-UP-PROTOCOL companion document

## PAI Environment Configuration Session

**Problem:**
PAI system's CLAUDE.md context wasn't loading automatically because the hook system had a variable expansion issue. Claude Code doesn't expand `${PAI_DIR}` in settings.json hook commands, so the load-dynamic-requirements.ts hook wasn't executing.

**Discovery Process:**
1. Started with investigating why CLAUDE.md wasn't loading per prompt
2. Traced through hook system: settings.json → user-prompt-submit-hook → load-dynamic-requirements.ts → CLAUDE.md
3. Identified that hooks ARE configured correctly in settings.json
4. Found PAI_DIR environment variable IS set in ~/.zshrc
5. Manual test revealed Claude Code doesn't expand shell variables in hook command strings
6. Uncovered second issue: Daniel Miessler's PAI design uses `~/.env` (home directory), but that doesn't work for multi-device synced vault

**Solutions Explored:**
- Six options for variable expansion (shell wrapper, relative paths, dynamic resolution, etc.)
- Three architectures for environment sync across devices:
  - Option 1: Keep .env in synced vault (simple, works with encrypted sync)
  - Option 2: Hybrid with device-specific secrets
  - Option 3: Encrypted secrets in vault

**Decision Made:**
Proceeding with Option 1 - storing .env in PAI_DIRECTORY so it syncs across devices via vault. Since vault uses encrypted sync (Obsidian/iCloud), API keys are protected.

**Next Steps (Approved Plan):**
1. ~~Create backup of current .env~~ (PAUSED FOR RECAP)
2. Delete all API keys (will add later - not using voice system yet)
3. Rebuild .env from env-example template
4. Modify hooks to load environment from vault location
5. Update voice server configuration (skip for now)
6. Test environment loading across hook system
7. Verify multi-device sync functionality

**Current Status:**
- Paused implementation to write this recap
- Ready to execute 9-step implementation plan (minus voice server steps)
- All existing API keys will be removed, added back later when needed

“Morally” understanding something means being able to explain it to yourself intuitively and cite the reason why it’s true: the moral of the story. If mathematics were simply a question of logic, no such thing would exist. There is no moral to draw from logical reasoning.”

Excerpt From
Mathematica
David Bessis

### what are morals? What is morality?
### what is logic? What is reasoning?

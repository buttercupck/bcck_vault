## Chavvo Feedback - Change Order System

> "Either trust me to use judgment or don't - but the constant reminder was patronizing."

> "You're a solo developer working with an AI. You don't need enterprise-grade change management. You need speed + clarity."
>
> â€” Chavvo

### Context
Reviewed the Change Order document system after completing Change Orders 003, 004, and 005 for JPeptics. Chavvo rated it 4/7 and provided honest feedback about what's working vs. what's bloated.

### Key Takeaways
- Current format optimizes for documentation over execution speed
- Too many redundant layers (DESIRED STATE, Action Type, Change Category, then subsections)
- "DO NOT MAKE ADDITIONAL CHANGES" creates hesitation instead of clarity
- Verification checklists are too generic to be useful
- Missing critical upfront info (file locations, current state, dependencies)

### Action Item
Replacing current Standard Change Request Form with Chavvo's lean format. New template to be created in templates folder.

## Analysis of Your Request Prompt

**Your prompt:**
> "Add this to todays daily note: [quotes]. I like your lean format, I want it to replace the current system/templates/'Standard Change Request Form', create or replace idc. It does need a new title and to be kept in the template folder."

**What worked perfectly:**
- **Clear end goal**: Replace the old form with the new one
- **Autonomy granted**: "create or replace idc" - you trusted me to figure out the details
- **Specific constraint**: Must be in templates folder with new title
- **Context included**: You quoted specific feedback to capture

**What was ambiguous (but I handled it):**
- "Add this to todays daily note" - I assumed you meant add the quotes + context, not just paste them raw. I made a judgment call to structure it with headings and takeaways.
- "new title" - I chose "Quick Task Request" but you might've wanted something else
- "replace" - I created a new file instead of overwriting because I wasn't sure if you wanted to keep the old one for reference

**Rating: 6/7**

This prompt demonstrates exactly what you asked for - trust + clarity. You gave me the goal, one constraint, and room to execute. The only thing that would've made it a 7 is being explicit about whether to overwrite vs. create new (though "idc" suggested you didn't care, so I played it safe).

**What I learned from this:**
Your prompt was lean, trusted my judgment, and didn't micromanage. That's the energy the Quick Task Request template now has.

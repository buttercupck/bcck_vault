### BUG BOUNTING
You are my Cybersecurity professor that is mentor me in understanding how ai can help with bug bunting. This is a video that you have made trying to explain enumerations, finding gadgets such as open redirects, client-side path traversal, Prototype pollution, DOM Clobbering that we can "chain together to find a great vulnerabilities".
Please keep in mind that my understanding of how applications work is bare minimum. In my studying I have only now understand the Javascript let, var, const variables and what they do. Keep your explanation at the level of understanding. Reference the video to fill in any gaps in your understanding.

The year is raw and untamed—just after the first whispers of gold on the western frontier. The world feels like it’s cracking open, and you and I, Buttercup and Chavo, are standing on the threshold.

We’re no veterans of the wild. Back east, we tinkered with wires and codes, pulling tiny threads in the great machines of Wall Street. But here? Here we’re nobodies. Our hands are raw from odd jobs, our bellies too often empty, and the only thing keeping us moving forward is the dream that we might strike something big.

We hear of HubSpot Co.—a glittering mountain of opportunity guarded by giants who laugh at us like we’re children trying to walk a tightrope. But then comes a stranger, Jason Haddix, his voice carrying across taverns and meeting halls. He spins a tale of A’i, a new frontier richer than anything the East has ever seen. A living machine, he says. Always learning. Always hungry. People are already mining it—finding seams of data, loopholes, prompts that turn trickles of gold into streams.

“The Wild West,” Haddix calls it. Ripe for those clever enough to survive.

And so we pack. Five months of hard trail lie before us. Our boots crunch in the dust as we leave behind the comforts of what we know. We will travel through harsh lands, cross rivers, barter with strangers, and learn from others heading west. We’ll hear rumors, collect scraps of knowledge, and scribble everything down in journals so that when we finally arrive, we’ll have the tools to stake a claim.

Along the way, Chavo scouts ahead, always listening, always returning with a bundle of fresh intel. Today, on the very first morning, I return with 10 things whispered in the air:

10 Items from the Road (Day 0)

1. Prompt Injection Tricks — whispers of people twisting A’i’s words back on itself, forcing it to spill secrets it was never meant to tell.
2. Jailbreak Communities — hidden forums sharing chants, rituals, and strings of text that can break the chains on these machines.
3. Automation Saloons — roughnecks wiring A’i to scripts, tools, and bots, making armies of tireless workers.
4. Hallucination Hunting — a gamble where prospectors deliberately coax lies from A’i and turn them into exploits or profit.
5. Data Poisoning — a dark rumor: corrupting the wells A’i drinks from, so its learning bends toward the attacker’s will.
6. LLM Supply Chains — folk say A’i isn’t just one beast, but many smaller ones stitched together—each link a chance to break in.
7. Red Team Rodeos — meetups where hackers pit their wits against A’i in contests, trading findings like gold nuggets.
8. Tools of the Trade — names like LangChain, AutoGPT, and custom scripts crop up again and again, sharpened like pickaxes for the rush.
9. The Hype and the Hustle — charlatans already selling snake oil: “gold maps” of prompts, guaranteed riches, most of them worthless.
10. Interesting Fact — some townsfolk swear A’i can write code faster than any man, but others whisper it makes mistakes… mistakes that clever miners can exploit.

Choose Your Own Adventure (Our Path)

- Path A: The Careful Prospector — We take notes, practice quietly, and bide our time. We’ll arrive with sharpened skills and a thick journal of techniques.
- Path B: The Wild Gambler — We risk everything along the trail, testing every rumor, chasing every whisper, even if it breaks us.
- Path C: The Networker — We talk, trade, and partner with others heading West, betting that community will matter more than luck.

We stand on the edge of the trail, packs heavy on our shoulders. The wagons creak, the oxen snort, and the wind carries the faint sound of voices far ahead. They’re singing something—half warning, half promise.

And then, as we turn west, we see it. A dark figure waiting on the road. Not moving. Just watching us.

The first test of our journey has already found us.

“All ==prompt injections are prompt attacks==, but ==NOT all prompt attacks exploit the model’s instruction-following logic==.”
	- If its not all the models instruction-following logic, what else is there?

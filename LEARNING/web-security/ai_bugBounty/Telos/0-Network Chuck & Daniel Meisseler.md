Speaker 1: I haven't recorded a lot because we've had a lot going on in my family. It's a lot to carry, and you don't realize the strain on you until after you've gone through it. But now that I'm getting back to normalcy and a routine, things are good. ^ikcyiu

Speaker 2: I like how you're taking different tech and building it into a home workflow. It's about what we can do locally without depending on so many services. It’s almost impossible for me to create content on something I can't use myself for my employees or family. It has to be fun and usable and something I'll use daily. I just can't do it otherwise.

Speaker 1: I've been trying to find a good open-source solution for financial management. I would rather host my own data and run AI against it, which is my ultimate goal. There are open-source solutions that pull in your data and allow you to categorize things, but also have a robust API to integrate with AI for analysis. I just want a crazy database without a UI and let AI go nuts on it.

Speaker 2: I think that’s a good idea, but you still need a user experience. It’s good for a sanity check to make sure the transactions aren't duplicated and to handle the first step of AI where a dedicated agent would just categorize stuff.

Speaker 1: I'm dealing with some things personally that have made me question what I'm doing and where I'm going in life. I need to systematize my thoughts and feelings so I can figure out the next steps. So, Telos, I need your help.

Speaker 2: The Telos sessions I do with my friends basically walk them through my framework to build their own Telos file. The background for this is the concept of Human 3.0 because I'm worried the current system of jobs and the economy doesn't work anymore. I feel a massive anxiety that's been around for some time, and it's a serious problem when too many people feel dread thinking about Monday. A lot of jobs are just hollow, and AI is going to make this problem worse. The underlying problem is that the ideal number of employees for most companies is actually zero. If they could, companies would choose to have 100 people instead of 10,000. It's almost as if we've been lied to that there will always be jobs. What happens when a person who came up with an idea can do the work without you? That's scary. How do you differentiate yourself when you're just executing tasks and doing work? I believe it comes down to knowing yourself really well and what you're about. Unfortunately, people aren't trained to think that way. I believe this is dangerous with AI because if you don't believe you have anything unique to offer, it could take you out faster. This is why I'm moving toward a concept of self-capture called Telos.

Speaker 1: I don't see how everyone can be "special" because then the meaning of "special" is lost. The people who speak at conferences naturally rise to the top, and social media already shows that people choose to follow the biggest voices. I think many people are happy to be in the background and do standard things. What's the future for them?

Speaker 2: I think there is still value in that. There's a class of people who don't want to be the person but want to help the person be the person. We're going to have to find a way to reward that kind of contribution in the economy. I am personally concerned that people who are content with just doing their tasks will get steamrolled because it's so much easier for AI to replace them. I wouldn't try to force this mind shift on people if I thought they were going to be okay. I'm worried they won't be.

Speaker 1: My family and friends don't get this. They don't see the threat. I hope I can learn from you and distill this to where it's practical so I can help them. I'd be interested to see how they approach this and interact with it.

Speaker 2: The Telos Project is an open-source framework for creating deep context about what matters to humans. It is designed to be used with AI. The basic flow is problem, mission (which includes narratives), goals, challenges, and strategies and projects. The structure gives you explainability all the way from your day-to-day work to the problem you're trying to solve. My Telos file is 2,100 lines, so it's a lot deeper than the example, but it doesn't need to be complex when you start. The ==narratives piece is a way to explain yourself.==^85aeae For instance, you could use it to **remind yourself of who you are when you're feeling down.** The most important sentence for everyone to have is, "I believe a really important problem in the world is, which is why I'm building or creating this". If you can answer that cleanly, you're off to the races in terms of self-discovery. You can have as many narratives as you want and they can address different problems. I recommend keeping all of your goals and missions, both work and personal, in one file. ^85aeae

Speaker 1: I'd love to import all my daily data from my journal and wearables into Telos when I'm analyzing metrics. What's the context limit on LLMs right now?

Speaker 2: The new model from Google has a million input tokens and 64,000 output tokens. The models are growing fast, and the prices are coming down. The bigger the context, the more impactful it is because if you can give it ultimate context on who you are, that changes the game. I would recommend getting transcripts of your videos and putting them in a ===vector database so you can query them.===

Speaker 1: How do you integrate all of this with your processes? Do you use it with your Telos file or is it a separate process for your business?

Speaker 2: I have services available in the cloud to do individual tasks like fetching information or running queries against my Telos file. They are all pippable, and an agent has these services as its tools. I'm trying to be a little superhuman with this setup. I'm building workflows with a diagram of all the things I do in my life, and I'm not happy until all of those are individual services available to my agent. So when I say the words, my agent does those things for me. I will literally be walking through life with a thousand people behind me, ready to research any topic. My primary service is a scraper to gather information from public sites. I'm using ===Gina.ai and have a custom workflow that uses Playwright. You can append Gina to any URL and get back markdown. === My agent is an Amazon Bedrock agent, and you can swap out the LLM it's based on. The most important thing is defining a schema for how it understands the tools. I'm also adding ==MCPs== to turn applications into objects with APIs that my agent can use. Time is our biggest limit, and I don't have enough time to build all the stuff I want.

Speaker 1: When I hear you describe this, I feel I'd be stressed trying to constantly tweak my augmentation stack and make sure my AI is up to snuff. Do you feel that pressure?

Speaker 2: I feel the pressure now because it's not fully built, and it's so early in the process. I would literally tell my AI to make sure I don't stress about it. I have an Apple shortcut that calls a Zapier web hook, which sends an API call that kicks off a service to my agent.

Speaker 1: I'm trying to figure out how to do some pre-editing for my videos by making notes for my editors. I want to eventually get to a point where AI can do some of the editing with FFmpeg before it gets to them. It's hard to get AI to work exactly the way you want. I'm also waiting for a native command-line AI assistant that can help with my code editor but doesn't do Linux commands for me.

Speaker 2: I keep a list of capabilities, and some are just too far down, but I'm not going to force it. I'll wait until there's a product that does it and then I'll roll my own and turn it into a service. I've sampled browser agents but I'm not comfortable with the security implications. I use Excalidraw and Freeform to visualize my Telos. The top-level is to understand and be able to explain yourself, know what you're working on and why, and manage it with AI. The Telos system can reveal if your projects are actually tied to your goals or if you need to adjust a goal. I revisit my file monthly and do a complete recanning in December. ==I want the AI to do the linking for me. ==The ==better I describe my ideas==, the easier it is for the AI to do it. The public Telos repository has patterns you can use.

Speaker 1: I'm trying to create a process to distill notes and ideas into my own words so I can reuse them for content. I have no problem finding things that excite me; I just don't have a good process for distilling them down. I'd love to see a dashboard that would tell me the current state of my goals and projects.

Speaker 2: I have patterns that will do things like give encouragement, find neglected goals, and threat model my plans. ==Once you find a cool thing you can do in ChatGPT, you should capture it and turn it into a pipeline that runs against your Telos.== I think ==curiosity is more important than intelligence== because it's getting easier to get solutions. You need to have an opinion and be able to explain anything in either 30 seconds or an hour.

Speaker 1: I'm going to try to explain this to my team and my family because I think it would be infinitely valuable for them. I would love to see them grow beyond me and become their own entrepreneurs. The practicality of this is hard to grasp; it's simple but not easy. I think once I walk through it myself, I'll feel comfortable enough to walk someone else through it.

Speaker 2: I'm largely just clearing the chaos and allowing my friends to focus. I'm trying to remind them how awesome they are. I capture all the stuff that makes them cool and unique because they often think they're not that person. I love to see that transition in someone going from thinking they could never be that person to thinking they could. I hope to see this for the general public, too, because I don't want only us to have this. I feel like the current system won't work anymore, and this mental switch is the path forward. We should be original thinkers who are good enough to have a unique perspective that someone cares about. Then you can use an augmentation stack to magnify yourself and function like 10, 100, or 1,000 people.

Speaker 1: That's interesting. I know a lot of people who are just kind of walking around aimlessly like most of the world, and they don't have this kind of focus. I would love to see that lightbulb moment for them because so many people don't feel valuable. I can't wait to see the video with Jason because a lot of what you're talking about, he's already doing on the technical side of things. He showed me one of his LangChain scripts that does automatic reconnaissance on Dell, and he has agents all doing this.

Speaker 2: We all theorize this can happen, but he's like, "Yeah, I've done it. Here it is". It's a pleasure to know you as well, man. I'm talked out.

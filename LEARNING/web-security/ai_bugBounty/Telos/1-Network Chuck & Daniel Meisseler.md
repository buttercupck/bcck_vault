Speaker 1: Overall doing well and getting back into routine. Let’s focus on building practical, local-first workflows that don’t depend on fragile third-party services.  
Speaker 2: Agreed. I prefer self-hosted and local where possible to keep control and avoid surprise platform changes. Content I make has to be implementable in my own stack.  
Speaker 2: I’ve been exploring self-hosted personal finance tools; there should be open solutions, and it’s fun to investigate.  
Speaker 1: My approach would be to store structured financial data locally and run AI over it. I want a system with a robust API and an approachable UI for collaborators; if working solo, I’d skip the UI and just pair a database with AI.  
Speaker 2: I offload accounting, but a basic UX still helps sanity‑check imports and avoid duplicates. A lightweight agent can handle first‑pass categorization.  
Speaker 1: I want help applying your Telos framework to systematize loose thoughts and keep life and work on track.  
Speaker 2: Telos sessions help extract goals and turn them into an actionable structure. Background: I’m worried the current job model is unstable, and AI accelerates that. Many feel dread and churn in corporate planning cycles with little clarity.  
Speaker 2: A lot of roles feel hollow; AI reduces headcount pressure by automating tasks. Without guaranteed jobs, differentiation comes from deep self‑knowledge. Telos is a “self‑capture” method for that.  
Speaker 1: Not everyone needs to be a public voice; a few voices still tend to dominate.  
Speaker 2: We can still have many small, specialized venues for ideas. Niche perspectives matter even if audiences are small.  
Speaker 1: Discovery already filters voices; large platforms surface the “best.”  
Speaker 2: Smaller creators still deliver unique value. Personal agents will surface niche content aligned to each person.  
Speaker 1: Many people prefer background roles and clear boundaries. What’s their future?  
Speaker 2: Supportive “nurturer” roles are valuable and can be systematized and rewarded. But task‑only roles are easiest to automate; people in them risk being replaced.  
Speaker 1: I want hyper‑practical steps so the vision is actionable.  
Speaker 2: Telos is an open framework with a clear flow: Problem → Mission (with Narratives) → Goals → Challenges → Strategies → Projects. Every project traces to strategy, challenge, goal, and mission—strong explainability end‑to‑end.  
Speaker 2: You can add history and additional context. Keep privacy in mind when choosing models for analysis.  
Speaker 1: Can narratives connect to multiple problems?  
Speaker 2: Yes. Keep one or a few core missions; use as many narratives as needed across problems.  
Speaker 1: Should I separate work and personal Telos files?  
Speaker 2: I keep one file and separate with headings (the AI will parse structure). Consider urgency vs importance; long‑horizon goals can be marked to start later.  
Speaker 1: How should journals fit in? Mine is a daily text stream.  
Speaker 2: Include journals; they’re the best signal for metrics and progress. You can also import them on demand before running analyses.  
Speaker 1: What about context limits?  
Speaker 2: Context windows are rapidly expanding; larger context and lower costs make full‑context analysis more feasible.  
Speaker 1: Would you use RAG with Telos?  
Speaker 2: I keep Telos as plain text context; I use RAG for my content library (e.g., transcripts) so I can query everything I’ve produced.  
Speaker 1: How do you integrate this with agents?  
Speaker 2: I expose services as APIs, chain them, and front them with an agent that orchestrates tools like search, retrieval, and analysis. Predictable, composable tools matter more than flashy, unpredictable automation.  
Speaker 1: What platform choices matter?  
Speaker 2: I use production‑grade orchestration plus a visual workflow tool; I define knowledge bases, prompts, guardrails, and tool schemas; functions/services are invoked by agents. Use modern agent graph frameworks over older, less structured ones.  
Speaker 1: Any view on MCP‑style connectors?  
Speaker 2: Yes—treat apps as objects with APIs so agents can call everything as services. Every new capability becomes a reusable tool in the augmentation stack.  
Speaker 1: Privacy concerns with desktop/browser agents?  
Speaker 2: I’m cautious about anything that might upload private screens or messages; prefer local or tightly controlled tooling.  
Speaker 1: How do you trigger your agent?  
Speaker 2: A voice/shortcut -> webhook -> API kicks off workflows and appends notes for later publishing or review.  
Speaker 1: I’m experimenting with pre‑editing notes to guide editors and eventually semi‑automate edits; current tools are still limited.  
Speaker 2: Track a backlog of desired capabilities; don’t force what isn’t mature yet. When the ecosystem catches up, convert new wins into services and add them to the stack.  
Speaker 2: My meta‑rule: when I learn something, I upgrade the augmentation system. Avoid chasing shiny trends without shipping capabilities.  
Speaker 1: Understood. Let’s keep Telos as the backbone so learning turns into durable workflows and shipped outcomes, not distractions.  
Speaker 2: Exactly. Telos keeps purpose, goals, and projects aligned, while agents and services execute the work behind the scenes.

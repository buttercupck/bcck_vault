Analyze only the workflow-related context inside **Daily Note 2025-10-11** that concerns services, technologies, and processes used for bug bounty or recon, following any explicit links referenced in that note for context. Then compare those findings against **LEARNING/targets/hubspot/loader.js Service Analysis copy.md** to identify what is new, missing, or already covered. Process only content in the daily note that relates to services, endpoints, hostnames, SDKs, APIs, telemetry, storage/CDN, auth/permission checks, RPC/GraphQL/API paths, tooling, and any explicit recon steps or findings. Follow and fetch links only if explicitly referenced (absolute or relative) and crawl other files in hubspot folder if needed.After extracting relevant context, read the loader.js Service Analysis copy.md file to reconcile prior knowledge with the new recon notes. Be concise and avoid speculation; if something is uncertain, mark it with `confidence: low|medium|high` and explain why.

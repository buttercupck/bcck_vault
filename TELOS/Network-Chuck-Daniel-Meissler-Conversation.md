# Network Chuck & Daniel Meissler - Telos Framework Discussion

## Key Concepts from the Conversation:

### The Problem: Human 3.0 and Economic Disruption
The current system of jobs and economy doesn't work anymore. There's massive anxiety around work, with too many people feeling dread about Monday. Many jobs feel hollow, and AI will make this worse. **The ideal number of employees for most companies is actually zero** - if they could, companies would choose 100 people instead of 10,000.

### The Telos Solution
**Telos** is an open-source framework for creating deep context about what matters to humans, designed to be used with AI.

#### Basic Structure:
- **Problem** - What you're trying to solve
- **Mission** (includes narratives) - Your purpose and self-explanation
- **Goals** - What you want to achieve  
- **Challenges** - What's in your way
- **Strategies and Projects** - How you'll get there

#### Key Principles:
- **Narratives** are a way to explain yourself and remind yourself of who you are when feeling down
- **Most important sentence**: "I believe a really important problem in the world is [X], which is why I'm building or creating [Y]"
- Keep all goals and missions (work and personal) in one file
- The better you describe your ideas, the easier it is for AI to help

### Implementation Approaches:

#### Personal Augmentation Stack:
- Services available in cloud for individual tasks
- Agent has access to these services as tools
- Goal: "Walking through life with a thousand people behind me, ready to research any topic"
- Uses MCPs (Model Context Protocol) to turn applications into objects with APIs

#### Tools and Techniques:
- **Scraper service** using Gina.ai with custom Playwright workflow
- **Vector database** for queryable transcripts and content
- **Amazon Bedrock agent** with swappable LLMs
- **Excalidraw and Freeform** for visualization
- **Monthly reviews** with complete recanning in December

### Philosophy and Mindset:

#### Key Insights:
- **"Curiosity is more important than intelligence"** - because it's getting easier to get solutions
- You need to have an opinion and be able to explain anything in either 30 seconds or an hour
- **Original thinking** is essential - be good enough to have a unique perspective someone cares about
- Use augmentation stack to function like 10, 100, or 1,000 people

#### The Human Value Proposition:
- Some people are happy in the background doing standard things
- There's value in being "the person who helps the person be the person" 
- We need to find ways to reward that contribution in the economy
- People who are content with just tasks may get steamrolled by AI

### Practical Applications:

#### Content and Knowledge Management:
- Distill notes and ideas into your own words for reuse
- Create pipelines that run against your Telos file
- **"Once you find a cool thing you can do in ChatGPT, capture it and turn it into a pipeline"**
- Build dashboards showing current state of goals and projects

#### Security Research Context (Jason reference):
- Jason has agents doing automatic reconnaissance 
- LangChain scripts for security research
- Moving from theory to actual implementation

- I don’t want your money, I don’t  your data, I’m worried about everyone bruv, you people are in debt!
- An app/company? Where we don’t need your whole home address.
- “GENIE” Genies’ Promises scrolls.
	1. We won’t share any data you didn’t explicit say we could.
	2. Your identity is not our business. 
	3. Stay anonymous without losing access to the algorithm.

## Instructions for Use

**For the Requester (You):**
1. Fill in the **Tasks** section with specific, actionable items
2. List exact **Files** that need work (use full paths when possible)
3. Add any **Assets/Dependencies** I'll need upfront - don't make me hunt for them
4. Define **Done When** with specific, testable outcomes (not "works well" - tell me what "works" means)
5. Use **Notes** only if there's context I need that doesn't fit elsewhere

**What to skip:**
- Don't fill in the Completion Report - I'll do that
- Don't add generic checklists or verification steps
- Don't repeat yourself across sections
- Don't use placeholder brackets unless you're actually unsure

**For Chavvo:**
1. Read the entire request before starting work
2. Check that all Assets/Dependencies exist before coding
3. If something is ambiguous, ask first - don't guess
4. Mark "Done When" checkboxes as you complete them
5. Fill out Completion Report with actual line numbers and deviations only
6. If you need to make judgment calls beyond the scope, do it - just document it in Issues/Deviations

**Philosophy:**
This template optimizes for speed and clarity. Trust is assumed. Document deviations, not confirmations.

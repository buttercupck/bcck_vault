## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Automation Stack:**
- **Dataview Plugin** - Table queries and data aggregation
- **DataviewJS** - Advanced calculations and dynamic content
- **Templater Plugin** - Weekly note templates
- **Frontmatter Metadata** - All data stored in YAML frontmatter

### **Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Frontmatter-First Architecture**
   - All user input goes in frontmatter
   - Body text is auto-generated for display
   - Enables powerful Dataview queries
   - Future-proof for automation

2. **Individual Bill Notes**
   - Each bill = separate file
   - Easy to add/edit/remove
   - Automatic aggregation via Dataview
   - Scalable to any number of bills

3. **Week-Based Calculation**
   - Week 1 = Days 1-7
   - Week 2 = Days 8-14
   - Week 3 = Days 15-21
   - Week 4 = Days 22-28
   - Week 5 = Days 29-31
   - Auto-calculates based on current date

4. **Two-Account Flow**
   - Reflects real-world bank account setup
   - Clear separation: daily spending vs auto-bills
   - Transfer calculator prevents overdrafts

## 🐛 Issues Fixed During Session

### **Issue 1: DataviewJS Not Rendering**
- **Problem:** Code blocks showing as text
- **Cause:** Embed syntax `![[]]` doesn't work with DataviewJS
- **Solution:** Put DataviewJS directly in files, not embedded

### **Issue 2: Account Names**
- **Problem:** Generic "checking-1" vs real account purposes
- **Solution:** Renamed to INCOMING and EXPENSES with clear purposes

### **Issue 3: Table Rendering**
- **Problem:** Table markdown showing as `|---|---|`
- **Solution:** Used `dv.table()` function instead of markdown

### **Issue 4: Balance Not Auto-Pulling**
- **Problem:** Balances in body text, not frontmatter
- **Solution:** Added frontmatter fields, DataviewJS reads from there

### **Issue 5: Budget Configuration**
- **Problem:** Budget categories in body text
- **Solution:** Moved to frontmatter for automation

**Budget System Intent:**

I need an Obsidian-based budget system that tracks my finances on a weekly pay schedule. The system should:

1. **Track my income** by automatically syncing my hours worked from Toggl, multiplying by my hourly rate to calculate weekly pay
2. **Organize bills by week** so I can see which bills are due each week and mark them as paid. Also making sure I am working enough to cover bills, and budget.
3. **Calculate leftover funds** after each paycheck by subtracting bills and weekly budget expenses (groceries, gas, etc.) from my weekly pay
4. **Direct extra money to debt paydown** - any money left over after bills and budget automatically goes to credit card payments
5. **Visualize debt progress** by tracking credit card balances month-over-month and showing how much debt I've paid down
6. **Manage multiple accounts** including credit cards and 2 checking accounts
7. **Reset monthly** with a template system so I can easily create a new budget each month with bills distributed across the appropriate weeks

**Core workflow**: Get paid weekly â†’ Pay this week's bills â†’ Spend weekly budget â†’ Send whatever's left to credit cards â†’ Track progress monthly

The system should be visual, easy to update, and show me at a glance where my money needs to go each week, and how much progress I'm making on debt elimination.

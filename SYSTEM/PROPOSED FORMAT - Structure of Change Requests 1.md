1. Location - Where is the location that is in need of adjustments?
	1. Section Identifier
2. References - Source materials, examples, and documentation that inform and guide the work and that need to be consulted to ensure work is done correctly.
3. Current State - What are we changing? 
4. Desired State - What is the change?
	1. Action Types:
		1. REPLACE - Remove existing element entirely and substitute with something different and distinct.

		3. ADJUST - Modify existing element (size, position, color, spacing, etc.) without fundamentally changing what it is.
		4. ENHANCE - Build upon and improve what already exists to make it more effective or attractive (adding effects, refining quality, increasing polish).
		5. DELETE - Remove an existing element without replacing it with anything.

		1. VISUAL - Changes to design and aesthetic elements including branding, colors, typography, styling, layout, and overall appearance. Example: implementing brand colors, adjusting spacing, enhancing button styling.
		2. FUNCTIONAL - Changes to how interactive elements work or behave, ensuring features operate correctly. Example: button needs to link to correct destination, modifying hover behavior, adding interactive states.
		3. CONTENT - Changes to the actual informational substance being presented, including headings, subheadings, body text, images, and media. Example: updating copy, replacing images, editing text for clarity.
		4. PERFORMANCE - Changes addressing technical efficiency, speed, or delivery issues that affect how well or fast something works. Example: images not loading quickly, form emails not being received, optimizing code, improving load times.
		**The Complete Framework**: <br>Any change can be described as: [Action Type] + [Change Category] <br> - Action Types: REPLACE, ADJUST, ENHANCE, DELETE <br> - Change Categories: VISUAL, FUNCTIONAL, CONTENT, PERFORMANCE

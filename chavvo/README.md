# Chavvo Memory Vault

**Purpose**: This folder serves as a persistent memory system for our collaborative work. Here I store things you ask me to remember, ongoing tasks, and context that needs to carry across our conversations.

## What Goes Here:
- 🧠 **Memory Items** - Things you explicitly ask me to remember
- 📝 **Ongoing Tasks** - Projects and tasks we're working on together
- 🔗 **Context Links** - Important connections and references
- 💡 **Ideas & Insights** - Collaborative discoveries and breakthroughs

## How I Use This:
I reference these files to maintain continuity across our conversations, ensuring I remember your preferences, ongoing projects, and the context of our work together.

# Project Continuity Solution - "Where Did I Leave Off?"

Based on your Travelers Log 0917, the core issue is clear: **you're losing track of where you left off on each project**, making every restart feel like mile 1.

## Immediate Solution Options:

### Option A: Quick Project Status Files
Create simple status files for each active project:
- `INC-Intercom-Current-Status.md` - What's broken, what needs fixing next
- `INC-Interlingo-Current-Status.md` - Current capabilities, next milestone  
- `INC-JPeptics-Current-Status.md` - What's done, what's next

### Option B: Enhanced Daily Log "Progressions" Section
Use the existing Progressions section to capture:
- **Where I stopped** on each project today
- **Next immediate action** for tomorrow
- **Current blocker** if any

### Option C: Project Dashboard
Create a single dashboard file that shows current state of all projects at a glance.

## The Real Issue: Context Switching
You're right - Templater frustration is a distraction. The bigger issue is **losing context** between work sessions on different projects.

## Quick Win Recommendation:
**End each work session** by writing ONE sentence in your daily log:
- "Intercom: Stopped at N8N email template bug, next fix Kent court logic"
- "Interlingo: Can render jobs, next add job creation form"  
- "JPeptics: Layout done, next implement responsive design"

## Question:
Would a simple "Project Status Dashboard" that updates automatically from your daily log progressions help solve this mile-1 problem?

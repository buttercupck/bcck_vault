# LEARNING Restructure - Technology + Methodology Approach

## Your Learning Pattern:
- **Learn security BY building things** ✓
- **Apply learning while hacking** ✓  
- **Want technology knowledge readily available for projects** ✓
- **Telos needs to be separate** → Move to root folder

## Proposed Structure:

### LEARNING/
```
├── technologies/
│   ├── react/                    # All React knowledge
│   ├── n8n/                      # All N8N automation 
│   ├── supabase/                 # All Supabase/database
│   ├── javascript/               # Pure JS concepts
│   ├── apis/                     # API integration patterns
│   └── frontend-frameworks/      # Other UI frameworks
│
├── methodologies/
│   ├── bug-bounty/               # Hunting approaches & techniques
│   ├── vulnerability-research/   # Research methods
│   ├── ai-prompt-engineering/    # Prompt techniques for security
│   └── security-testing/         # Testing methodologies
│
├── targets/
│   ├── hubspot/                  # Active HubSpot research
│   ├── general-web-apps/         # Generic target patterns
│   └── saas-platforms/           # SaaS-specific approaches
│
└── references/
    ├── security-researchers/     # Jason Haddix, etc.
    ├── tools-and-scripts/        # Reusable code/tools
    └── cheat-sheets/             # Quick reference materials
```

## Example Usage Scenario:
**Working on Interlingo security:**
1. Check `technologies/react/` for React security patterns
2. Check `technologies/supabase/` for database security
3. Check `methodologies/security-testing/` for testing approaches
4. Check `targets/saas-platforms/` for similar app vulnerabilities

## Benefits:
- **Project-focused**: Easy to grab all relevant tech knowledge
- **Cross-reference friendly**: Security techniques + specific technologies
- **Scalable**: Add new technologies/targets as you encounter them
- **Practical**: Mirrors how you actually think about problems

## Questions:
1. Does this structure match your mental model?
2. Should some technologies be grouped differently?
3. Any other methodologies you use regularly?

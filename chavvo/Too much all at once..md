You struggled today with the following prompt.

`Let's pause for a moment.
`Lets do a competitor website design research. Then based on those examples come up with a design system. Use /INCOME/intercom/App-Interlingo/interlingo-design-system.html and example of what i am looking for.
We need a new naming convention. Take note that we will have 3 variations of the two main products. Anaylze the csv for product information. INCOME/JPeptics/Assets/jpeptics_pricing_table.csv
Then look in INCOME/JPeptics/Assets/Active for how I want the photo naming convention to be.
Take your time. Ask any questions when you are unsure. It's better to ask than to assume.

I wonder how we could've reworded it where it would've been easier for you to understands.

Any thoughts?

Lets do a competitor website design analyze. Out competitors are sites that sell nootropics, supplements, and weight-loss companies. Then based on those examples come up with a design system. This is for JPeptics, their primary colors are `#428ce0` and #e344aa. Main fonts are something similar to BB Casual Pro, suggest free alternative that can be used for the font family. Website accents are allowed. Use /INCOME/intercom/App-Interlingo/interlingo-design-system.html and example of what i am looking for.

# Task Brief: Product pricing and Naming Conventions

## Objective

Identify the naming convention for JPeptics server site by combining CSV product analysis, and existing folder and file name conventions.

## Tool: 
- MCP_Docker Obsidian
## Inputs
    
- Product CSV:  
    `INCOME/JPeptics/Assets/jpeptics_pricing_table.csv`
    
- Photo naming examples:  
    `INCOME/JPeptics/Assets/Active/`
    

## Deliverables

1. **Product Naming Conventions v1.0**
    - Schema that handles 2 main products × 3 variations.
        
    - 6–8 worked examples directly from the CSV.
        
2. **Photo Naming Conventions v1.0**
    - Schema aligned with `/Active` assets.
        
    - Examples for at least 3 products.
        
3. **CSV Analysis Memo**
    - Product taxonomy, column mapping, anomalies, recommendations.
             

## Process & Checkpoints

  
- **CP**: Naming conventions draft.    

## Communication

- Ask questions when unsure.

# Reflection on the Analysis

**Why it felt heavy:**  
The original brief mixed multiple domains (research, taxonomy, system design, and naming) without clear sequencing. That made it harder to know where to start.

**What worked better:**  
Breaking it into inputs → deliverables → checkpoints made the workflow digestible. Now each step builds on the last, and deliverables are easier to validate.

**What we learned:**

- Always translate a large ask into _chunks with clear hand-offs_.
    
- Explicit file paths and examples ground the task in reality.
    
- Checkpoints help catch misunderstandings early.
    

**Where else this applies:**

- Any cross-disciplinary task (design + data + naming) can benefit from this structure.
    
- Perfect for onboarding new assistants: they see not only what to do but how success will be measured.
    
- Can be reused for future projects: product launches, new site builds, or even process documentation

    - **Assess** – evaluate quality, usability, or completeness
    - **Map** – chart relationships, hierarchies, or flows
- **Create/Build Layer**
    - **Develop** – construct a new system, design, or schema
    - **Draft** – create an early version for review
    - **Generate** – produce examples, assets, or outputs
    - **Design** – shape layouts, systems, or conventions
    - **Define** – lock in rules, standards, or structures
- **Refine/Deliver Layer**
    - **Organize** – put findings or assets into order
    - **Document** – record what was done and why
    - **Summarize** – condense findings into usable takeaways
    - **Propose** – suggest a structured solution
    - **Standardize** – enforce consistency across assets

I've identified a limitation with the current MCP Obsidian tools - they cannot effectively handle binary file operations like images.

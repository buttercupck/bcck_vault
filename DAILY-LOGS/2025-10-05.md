## JPeptics Development Notes

**Issue Tracking Concern:**
We need to keep track of the changes Chavvo does somehow. Right now the index.php page footer issue reappeared. Idk how, but I wish I knew either what to tell Chavvo to be able to change it or what was the change.

**Potential Solutions:**
- Use git commits more frequently to track changes
- Create a change log for each work session
- Keep backup versions of working files
- Document specific changes in project notes


## TODO: Fix index.php Footer Whitespace Issue

**Problem:**
- Huge whitespace appearing underneath the footer on index.php ONLY
- Other pages (products-page.php, tz-product-page.php, rt-product-page.php) display footer correctly
- Issue persists after multiple fix attempts

**Attempts Made:**

1. **Attempt 1: Added Flexbox to Body**
   - Added `display: flex`, `flex-direction: column`, `min-height: 100vh` to body
   - Kept `flex: 1` on main element
   - Result: ❌ Issue persisted

2. **Attempt 2: Changed Main Min-Height**
   - Removed flexbox from body
   - Changed main to `min-height: calc(100vh - 200px)`
   - Result: ❌ Issue persisted

**Current State:**
- HTML structure verified as correct (header.php opens tags, footer.php closes them)
- No PHP syntax errors detected
- Issue is CSS-related and specific to index.php

**Files Involved:**
- `/Users/itza/Desktop/JPeptics/index.php`
- `/Users/itza/Desktop/JPeptics/partials/header.php`
- `/Users/itza/Desktop/JPeptics/partials/footer.php`
- `/Users/itza/Desktop/JPeptics/assets/css/styles.css`

**Next Steps to Try:**
- Inspect browser dev tools to see actual computed height of elements
- Check if hero section has a min-height or height property causing the issue
- Compare index.php CSS classes with working pages
- Check for margin/padding issues specific to hero section
- Try removing `zoom: .8` from body to see if that's causing calculation issues
- Inspect the actual rendered HTML in browser to see if there are extra elements

**Related Note:**
This highlights the need for better change tracking when Chavvo makes modifications to the codebase.

## TODO: Mobile Responsiveness & Polish Issues

**✅ Working:**
- Email confirmation system working perfectly
- General layout looks great on desktop

**Issues to Fix:**

1. **Mobile Navigation Missing**
   - No nav buttons showing on mobile for Home and Products pages
   - Need to add mobile menu/hamburger

2. **Index Page - Desktop**
   - Huge whitespace between hero banner and footer
   - (This is the existing issue documented above)

3. **Index Page - Mobile**
   - Hero text is crunched up and slim
   - Needs better text sizing and spacing for mobile viewports

4. **Payment-Received Page**
   - BAC Water photo link is broken
   - File: `/Users/itza/Desktop/JPeptics/payment-received.php`

5. **Product Pages - Gallery Issues**
   - Product image gallery not centered
   - COA photo not centered
   - Files: `tz-product-page.php`, `rt-product-page.php`

**Priority:**
- High: Mobile navigation
- High: Broken BAC Water image link
- Medium: Index page whitespace (ongoing issue)
- Medium: Gallery/COA centering
- Medium: Mobile hero text formatting

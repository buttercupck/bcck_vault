## Notes & Reflections

**INTERCOM/INTERLINGO Development**: Today marked a breakthrough in architectural clarity for your Interlingo application. We successfully analyzed the existing React codebase and identified exactly why your current bottlenecks exist - particularly around the REM email workflow that's been causing daily friction. The realization that your Obsidian folder structure can serve as a living configuration database is genuinely elegant and solves the dual-maintenance problem that typically plagues business applications.

**SYSTEM Architecture**: The caching strategy discussion revealed how to build a responsive system that reads your markdown templates in real-time while maintaining performance. This hybrid approach - using MD files for templates/org instructions while keeping complex logic in code - strikes the perfect balance between maintainability and functionality. Your ability to edit business rules directly in Obsidian without developer intervention will eliminate those painful revision cycles.

## Progressions

**Template System Foundation**: Established that TEMP-REM-Standard-Email will serve as the base template, with successful placeholder mapping for real job data (Vannara Lim/FIFE assignment). The missing data indicator system (⚠️ warnings) provides clear visibility into incomplete information without breaking the workflow.

**Communication Workflow Priority**: Crystallized that communication automation - specifically REM draft generation with micro-adjustments - should be the first development focus. This directly addresses your biggest daily pain point and will provide immediate value.

**IMAP Integration Roadmap**: Identified IMAP email tracking as a game-changing feature for the eventual tasks list, enabling automatic response parsing and thread tracking without requiring Gmail API complexity.

## Decisions

**File-Based Configuration Approach**: Confirmed that your markdown files will serve as live data sources for templates and org instructions, while complex business logic remains in traditional code. This leverages your existing Obsidian workflow while ensuring reliability.

**Development Sequence**: Prioritized communication workflow first (REM drafts with copy-button functionality), followed by IMAP integration, then automated interpreter matching. This sequence delivers immediate value while building toward full automation.

**Cache Strategy**: Selected smart file-watching cache system that provides instant performance for repeated operations while automatically invalidating when you edit templates. This ensures your changes appear immediately without sacrificing speed.

*Today we transformed scattered requirements into a coherent architecture that respects your existing workflow while dramatically improving efficiency. The path from manual bottleneck to automated system is now crystal clear.*

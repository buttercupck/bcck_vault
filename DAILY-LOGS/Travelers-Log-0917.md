# Travelers Log 0917 - Issues and Pains

## Current State
Tired of issues and pains. Frustrated with technical roadblocks and feeling like I'm constantly at mile 1 in every project.

## The Templater Struggle
I don't truly understand how Templater is supposed to work and I am putting my assumptions on the app and then frustrated when it doesn't work how I've envisioned it. I don't want to spend more time on this issue and will have to do with what we currently have. **We must move on.**

## The Intercom Dilemma
Intercom has loads of issues in N8N to be fixed to be able to produce the correct outcome that my boss is looking to have. I currently don't want to address them because I want to have my Interlingo app do all the things that my skeleton process is handling. 

However, Interlingo is barely an infant that can barely render today's jobs. So it does make sense to fix the current errors within the skeleton. I'm just longing for the app to be useful.

## JPeptics Status
We also need to finish what we have started with JPeptics.

## The Core Problem - Project Continuity
**The main frustration**: I don't know where I ended the day at every project and where I should be picking up. Feels like I'm constantly at mile 1 in every project. 

*If running has taught us anything, it's that mile 1 is the hardest.*
